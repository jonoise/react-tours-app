## Tours display project.

On this project we developed a tours interface. We fetched data from a dummy API and render a Tour component with the ability to remove itself.

On this project with worked with:

- Async functions to fetch data from an API.
- UseState and UseEffect hooks.
- Delete items functionality.
- Show more/Show less functionality.

### Install.

To run the project just clone it, install dependencies and run start.

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
